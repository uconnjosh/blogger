    <dd>Up from the grave He arose!”

I closed my eyes as I belted out the words, and I could hear my momma’s off-key voice so clearly that she might as well have been sitting right next to me.

All of those Easter Sundays growing up, she’d belt out those words next to me.  She could hardly sit still, because she believed and lived the hope of those words every day.  Every year, just like the year before, she’d grab my hand and lift it higher than I felt comfortable, and with every new note, she’d pump our fists together in the air, worshipping with all that she had.

Off-key loud and all.

And now my poor boy sits next to me, and he might be praying that none of his friends are watching.  It’s Easter Sunday, and I just can’t contain myself.

But then Monday came. Life got hard. The crown of thorns, the cross, the nails - it all got blurry, and my faith was challenged once again.</dd>
